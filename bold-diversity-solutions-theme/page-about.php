            <h5 class="pb-3">The words we use, come out of our brain, but originate in our hearts. They show our true mindset, regardless of applause for our diversity statement or strategic plan.</h5>
            <p class="pb-3">A systematic framework of transformation to a diversity Agile mindset instills the everyday ability to recognize unequal oppression and microaggressions, and speak from a culturally relevant pedagogy of lifestyle learning. This uniquely trains both academic staff, faculty, and students in self-responsible learning and leadership, leads to higher test scores, and will effectively tackle the dropout rate in both high school and higher education. It is Eramus+ compliant, which means it will train all students for actual workplace success, out of the gate.</p>

            <p class="pb-3 text-muted"><em>"Chapter 16 – Teaching from the Native American Circle: an Innovative Teaching Framework – is written by Schooling. She presents a highly original process innovation, informed by a constructivist perception of learning, based on the Native American Circle. This Circle is unpacked and used by the author as a foundation for high impact teaching and learning in Native American Indian education. Its success is such that The Circle is now utilised in schools beyond the original large Bureau of Indian Education school’s original context, in which it had its first iterations." - <a href="https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=plICi5MAAAAJ&hl=en">Claus Nygaard</a></em></hp>
