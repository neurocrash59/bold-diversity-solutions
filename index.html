                        <p><strong>Use of Cookies And Pixels</strong></p>

                        <p>Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called
                            “cookies” and server logs to collect information about how our site is used. Information
                            gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the
                            pages viewed, time spent at our site, and the websites visited just before and just
                            after our own, as well as your IP address.</p>

                        <p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique
                            identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for
                            permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for
                            cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s
                            preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website
                            to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other
                            sites.</p>

                        <p>The Company reserves the right to use technological equivalents of cookies, including
                            social media pixels. These pixels allow social media sites to track visitors to outside
                            websites so as to tailor advertising messages users see while visiting that social media
                            website. The Company reserves the right to use these pixels in compliance with the
                            policies of the various social media sites.</p>​

                            terms of a specific product or service provide otherwise.</p>

                        <p>With respect to any purchase, you must request your money back within 30 days of the
                            purchase. You may request your money back by emailing <a
                                href="mailto:hello@bolddiversitysolutions.com">hello@bolddiversitysolutions.com</a>.
                            That email must contain information about the product you purchased, the date of the
                            purchase, and the email and name associated with any such purchase. You are not required
                            to submit any proof that you have completed any work or meet any other requirements.</p>

                        <p>Upon determining that you are entitled to a refund pursuant to this policy, the Company
                            will promptly issue an instruction to its payment processor to issue the refund. The

                            refunds.</p>

                        <p>If you receive a refund of any purchase through this money-back guarantee, that shall
                            immediately terminate any and all licenses granted you to use the material provided to

                            the material and shall destroy all copies of the information provided to you, including
                            without limitation: video recordings, audio recordings, forms, template documents, slide

                            customer shall not be entitled to a refund as to any other product or service purchased
                            from the Company. </p>
