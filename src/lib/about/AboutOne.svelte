				A systematic framework of transformation to a diversity Agile mindset instills the everyday
				ability to recognize unequal oppression and microaggressions, and speak from a culturally
				relevant pedagogy of lifestyle learning. This uniquely trains both academic staff, faculty,
				and students in self-responsible learning and leadership, leads to higher test scores, and
				will effectively tackle the dropout rate in both high school and higher education. It is
				Eramus+ compliant, which means it will train all students for actual workplace success, out
				of the gate.
