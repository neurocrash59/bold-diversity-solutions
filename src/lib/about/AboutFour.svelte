					"Chapter 16 – Teaching from the Native American Circle: an Innovative Teaching Framework –
					is written by Schooling. She presents a highly original process innovation, informed by a
					constructivist perception of learning, based on the Native American Circle. This Circle is
					unpacked and used by the author as a foundation for high impact teaching and learning in
					Native American Indian education. Its success is such that The Circle is now utilised in
					schools beyond the original large Bureau of Indian Education school’s original context, in
					which it had its first iterations." - <a
